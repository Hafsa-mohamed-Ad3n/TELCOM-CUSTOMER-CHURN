This problem statement seeks to address the imperative need for a comprehensive customer churn analysis that transcends traditional metrics. While churn rates provide a numerical representation of customer loss, a deeper exploration is essential to uncover the intricate reasons behind attrition.

This involves maximizing customer satisfaction, addressing their concerns proactively, and adapting the service to meet evolving consumer needs.

This analysis aims to provide actionable insights for stakeholders to proactively shape customer experiences and bolster retention efforts. Through this comprehensive approach, businesses can position themselves to not only minimize churn rates but also to maximize customer loyalty, thereby securing a resilient foothold in the competitive telecommunications market.
